- providing additional information about the type of data which is being passed 
  in order to get better support.
- for example, declaring Promise which will resolve string, in order to get 
  ts support for the string built in function later on.

examples: 

const people : Array<string> = []; // the same as string[]
const people : Array<string | number> = [];






const promise: Promise<string> = new Promise((resolve,reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve('he  this is resolved vladi')
    }, 3000);
});

promise.then(data=>{
    console.log(data.length)
})
