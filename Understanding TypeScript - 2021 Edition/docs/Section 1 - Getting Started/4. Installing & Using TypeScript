 - yarn add typescript --dev (or install it globably with -g flag  )
- we have targeted 2 input elements (input1 and input 2) in order to calculate their values 
  later on in the add function.
- we have receive an error from TS telling us that "value property does not exists on 'HTMLElement'
  type.
- this error was received as not every html element has this property (most of them have not).
- in order to avoid this error to be shown, we just using type casting ( as HTMLInputElement)
  saying that our element is cast (in run time) to an input element (ts INTERFACE)
- also, we are using Exclamation mark , in order to say that we are sure, that these elements 
  are exists in the DOM, it will not return null or undefined, (We haven no typo and we checked it and we are sure)
- also we are using types , when passing num1 and num 2 to add() function, saying that these 
  params will be of type number
- in order compile our ts file : tsc filename (tsc test.ts) - it is getting compiled, and we receive 
  back an js file with the compiled code


  const button = document.querySelector('button');
const input1 = document.getElementById("num1")! as HTMLInputElement;
const input2 = document.getElementById("num2")! as HTMLInputElement;

function add(num1: number,num2: number){
    return num1 + num2;
}

button.addEventListener('click',function(){
    console.log(add(+input1.value,+input2.value));
})
