- when class properties are private or protected,
  we still can gain access to them, via setters and getters 
- getter method has to return something
- setter method has to accept something
- access like a normal proeprty for both of them 
class Person {
    name:string = 'vladi';
    lastName:string = 'Iokhim';
    private age:number = 33;

    get getAge(){
        return this.age;
    }
    
    set setAge(age:number){
        this.age = age;
    }

}

const me = new Person();

//me.age = 34; // not accessibl outside of the class Person
console.log('me',me)
me.setAge = 34;
console.log(me.getAge)
