- even though custom (alias) types are similar to an interfaces,
  in order to define an object, we would often see an interface usage instead of a custom type.
- also with interfaces, we can define only objects , while custom type can be use for everything.
- we can implement more then 1 interface

interface Person {
    name:string;
    age:number;
    greeting:(phrase:string) => void;
}

interface SecondPerson {

}


class Per implements Person, SecondPerson {
    name:string = 'vladi';
    bla:number = 1;
    age:number;
    greeting:() => {};
}
