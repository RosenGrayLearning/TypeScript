Tuple - fixed length array ; this is not exists in JS, was added in TS (it does exists in many other langues)
 - for example: 
 ******************************
 const tuple = [1,2]; 
 const role = [2,author];
******************************

 const tuple:[number,number] = [1,2]; 
 const role:[number,string] = [2,'author'];

 - when we know how many items we would have in array, and what are their types - we might consider of using tuple instead of array
