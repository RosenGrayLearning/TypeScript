 - when working with union types, we might create a custom type which in the end, stores that union type.
 - in TS, we can create something that called : Custom Types ( or Type Aliases)
 - we create such Types with a "type" keyword

type OneOrTwoSomething = "one-something" | "two something";

let something : OneOrTwoSomething;

something = 'one-something';
