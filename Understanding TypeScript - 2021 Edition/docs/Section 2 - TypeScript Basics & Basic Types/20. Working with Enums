- and idea of having some global constants that we might working with in our app, which we want to represent as numbers, 
but to whichwe want to asign a human readle lable
- the convention is to set our Enums names as uppercase
- enum Role {value,value,value} 
**********************************
enum Role {ADMIN, READ_ONLY, AUTHOR};
**********************************

- each value will have automatically a numeric value according to it order 
console.log(Role.ADMIN) // 0
console.log(Role.READ_ONLY) // 1
console.log(Role.AUTHOR) // 2

- it starts with 0, but we can assign any other starting point - like this: 
**********************************
enum Role {ADMIN = 5, READ_ONLY, AUTHOR};
**********************************
- as a result:
console.log(Role.ADMIN) // 5
console.log(Role.READ_ONLY) // 6
console.log(Role.AUTHOR) // 7

- we can assign numbers to any other enum values 
- we can assign strings to them as well (or mix it)
